**Project Title:**  
StudentUnionDAO â€“ College Governance with DAO

**Project Description:**  
StudentUnionDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) created to manage college governance in a transparent and democratic manner using blockchain technology. The project replaces traditional student union decision-making processes with a decentralized platform where every student can participate in voting and proposals. It ensures transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in college administrative decisions, events, and resource allocation.

**Project Vision:**  
The vision of StudentUnionDAO is to empower students by providing a trustless, tamper-proof platform that fosters democratic governance within educational institutes. It aims to enhance student engagement, decentralize power from centralized college authorities, and create a fair and transparent environment where decisions are made collectively for the benefit of the entire student body.

**Key Features of the Project:**  
- **Decentralized Voting:** Enables students to participate in governance by voting on proposals, elections, and policies securely via blockchain.  
- **Proposal Submission:** Students can submit motions or proposals that require collective approval.  
- **Transparency:** All transactions, proposals, and voting results are immutable and publicly verifiable on the blockchain.  
- **Smart Contracts:** Automates voting, quorum validation, and implementation of decisions.  
- **Inclusive Participation:** Every enrolled student automatically becomes a DAO member with voting rights.  
- **Security:** Blockchain ensures data integrity and prevents tampering or fraud in governance records.
- **Event Management:** Decisions related to student events, funds, and clubs are managed transparently.
- **Resource Allocation:** Transparent tracking and approval of budget and resource allocation for student activities.
